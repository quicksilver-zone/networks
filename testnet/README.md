# Quicksilver Testnets

All Quicksilver testnets have been and will continue to be named after songs by Freddie Mercury and/or Queen, for no reason more than the guy was a lyrical and musical genius, and there is a somewhat tenuous link between Quicksilver -> Mercury -> Freddie that is ripe for exploitation.

# Rhye-3

The third installment of the "Rhye" long-running testnet is here.

Rhye-2 halted due to loss of hardware when migrating Quicksilver between Notional and Somatic Lab. It was decided to relaunch the testnet as `rhye-3`.

Rhye-3 is a clean launch, with entirely new state.

In order to onboard your new `rhye-3`, you must do the following:

1. Build, or download the Quicksilver v1.6.3 binary from https://github.com/quicksilver-zone/quicksilver; alternatively use the docker container at quicksilverzone/quicksilver:v1.6.3.
2. Run `quicksilverd init <moniker>`.
3. Download the genesis file in the rhye-3 folder to ~/.quicksilverd/config/genesis.json.
4. Assert the genesis file you downloaded matches the expected hash, using `cat ~/.quicksilverd/config/genesis.json | jq . -Sc | shasum -a256`. It should return `0c41baa29780c48d9a695700f38950a2e2f96e020875c3f6eb39c77d717dbce5`.
5. Start the process with `quicksilverd start`. You will probably want to run this as a service.
6. Once synced (check https://rhye-3.rpc.quicksilver.zone/status), you will want to create a key, get some funds from the faucet, and create your validator:

#### Create a key

```sh
$ quicksilverd keys add <key>
```

For example:

```sh
$ quicksilverd keys add testkey

- address: quick14xcgnfvmd9xzu5em2gr5d0ykepv4m0y4f4z8lk
  name: testkey
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AvE1BMXRvtydR95jRdrGzWOVpmlC1Uf6V5SazxxFTECa"}'
  type: local

#### Obtain funds

TBC.

#### Create a validator

```sh
$ quicksilverd tx staking create-validator \
--from <key> \
--amount 100000000000uqck \
--chain-id="rhye-3" \
--commission-rate="<commission>" \
--commission-max-rate="<max-commission>" \
--commission-max-change-rate="<max-commission-rate-change>" \
--min-self-delegation="<min-self-delegation>" \
```
